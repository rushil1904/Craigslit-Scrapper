### Annoyed with the outdated and basic UI of Craiglist? 

Here's [Craiglist Scrapper](https://scrapper-craigslist.herokuapp.com ), a website providing you a visually appealing and faster way to use Craigslist.

The site returns results for the Delhi location. Upon searching for any item, the website will return the results in a 3 column grid with the item's picture, title, description and price(if available). Clicking on an item will redirect you to its Craigslist listing and you can perform further actions according your interests(purchasing or saving it).
